# Introduction

Swissnet is an old, now defunct penetration-testing project. Its purpose was to explore network programming, sockets, and application design. Although its code is massively outdated, and does not reflect my programming abilities as of today, it's still a fun project.

## Installation

First, install python3 by running:

On Debian-Based systems:

```$ sudo apt-get install python3```

Then, clone the repo:

```$ git clone https://github.com/SemiDev/Swissnet.git```

Then, navigate to the projects directory:

```$ cd Swissnet/ ```

and Finally, use python to run the main.py file NOTE: Swissnet will not work without root privileges. 

```$ sudo python3 main.py```

#CLI Usage

To use the graphical interface, just execute the main.py file:

```$ sudo python3 main.py```
